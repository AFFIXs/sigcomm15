%Architecture: 
%  Affix component, Affix stack
%  how traffic from an application is pushed through the stack until it reaches a network for %
%      delivery (and an example)
%  Security model


In this section, we review the architecture of the 
Affix framework, which reflects the
properties described in Section~\ref{subsec-goals-properties}. 
Specifically, we describe the 
structure of an individual \textit{Affix component}
(Section~\ref{subsec-arch-components}), 
and how these may be connected so that multiple component operate on 
a single socket.
(Section~\ref{subsec-arch-stack}).
Next, in Section~\ref{subsec-arch-flow},
we describe how a network API call and the data 
it returns flows through Affix graphs and network links.

This work is subject to many of the same security issues as prior efforts
on active networks~\cite{wetherall2002active} and overlay 
networks~\cite{lua2005survey}.   For example,
there are issues related to who is allowed to add network functionality,
how resource and security isolation are performed for untrusted functionality,
and how the authenticity and integrity of downloaded network functionality
is assured.  We defer these issues to future work.

\subsection{Affix components}
\label{subsec-arch-components}

The smallest functional entity that fulfills 
all of the properties set out in Section~\ref{subsec-goals-properties} 
is an \textit{Affix component}. 
An Affix component is essentially an operator that transforms
an API function, its arguments, and its outcome, i.e.,
$y = f(x)$ into $y' = f'(x')$ (Figure~\ref{fig-component}).
Specifically, in the context of the socket API, 
an Affix component may transform any of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item data payload,
\item communication endpoints (e.g., IP or port), or
\item composition of Affix services beneath itself.
\end{itemize}


Any transformation is legal as long as the following 
conditions for interface compatibility 
are satisfied: $f$ and $f'$ must be valid 
API functions, $x$ and $x'$
must be valid inputs for $f()$ and $f'()$, respectively, and
$y$ and $y'$ must be possible outcomes for
the API calls $f(x)$ and $f'(x')$. (The outcome we refer to is 
not only the return value of the function, but also any effect it has
on system state.)
Figure~\ref{fig-fn} illustrates some of these requirements.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figs/fn.pdf} 
  \caption{A transformation is only legal if
  the transformed input $x$ is in the set of valid inputs for the API function
  $f$, and the new outcome $y$ is in the set 
  of valid outcomes for $f$. For the network API, this means 
  that the outcome $y$ could have been observed 
  for $f(x)$ on a correct network.}
  \label{fig-fn}
\end{figure}

API calls can be invoked in an 
Affix component by an application or by another component.
The call may then be transformed and invoked in another component, 
or in the network stack of the host \ac{OS}.
Return values from API calls are transformed and propagated to the 
caller in the reverse direction.

  another component, while returning transformed output

% Fraidy: I prefer to defer this to the implementation section
%
% The position of Affix components between the application and 
% the operating system's network stack 
% demands that they be compatible with 
% the socket API interface. This is true for both 
% the upwards (presenting a socket interface to the application or 
% Affix component above) 
% and the downwards direction (interfacing with the socket or 
% socket-like structure below it). 
% The Affix component is free in its design of internal workings as 
% long as it respects interface compatibility.

% In practice, interface compatibility requires that an Affix 
% component implements interfaces that match the different 
% groups of operations available on an actual socket, i.e. 
% address resolution (\texttt{getaddrinfo()}), 
% connection management (\texttt{listen()}, \texttt{connect()}, 
% \texttt{accept()}, etc.), 
% data flow (\texttt{send()}, \texttt{recv()} ...), 
% and possibly configuration (in the form of socket options).

% In addition to the interfaces required per the socket \ac{API}, 
% an Affix component must implement a number of Affix-specific 
% functions for instantiation and configuration, including 
% ones for combining multiple Affixes. We will discuss these 
% in an instant.


\subsubsection{Special components}
\label{special}

A particular API call is called \textit{transparent} for a component
if it  preserves interface semantics itself, without
requiring the application of another 
operation. That is, if the component transforms 
$y = f(x)$ into $y' = f'(x')$, and
$y'$ is also a valid output of $f(x)$, then $f(x)$
is transparent in this component. If every API call 
in a component has this property, then the entire component 
is transparent. For example, a \textit{RateLimit} service 
that performs traffic shaping
can be implemented in a transparent component.

In the socket API, the \texttt{send()}
 and \texttt{connect()} calls propagate data and associations, 
 respectively, while the \texttt{recv()} and \texttt{accept()}
 calls consume these.
If a propagating API function $f$ is not transparent for a component, 
then the component must also implement the consuming equivalent function 
$g$ such that the application of $f$ followed by $g$ 
preserves interface compatibility -- i.e., that it gives a 
result that could be observed on a correct network. 
\cappos{Assuming that a component must `mirror' itself... (see later comment
in 5.2)}
For example, if the \texttt{send()} call of a 
\textit{Compression} component 
compresses data before sending it over the network, 
the \texttt{recv()} call of the component should decompress 
received data before returning it to the application.


A component that transforms a propagating 
call into its consuming equivalent, and vice versa,
is called a \textit{mirroring} component. 
Mirroring components also reverse the direction 
of invocation on their output.
The network itself is modeled as a mirroring component, 
as it transforms API calls like \texttt{send()}  
into \texttt{recv()} calls. Figure~\ref{fig-mirroring}
shows how the network transforms a \texttt{send()}
call invoked on one side into a 
\texttt{recv} call on its other side.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/network.pdf} 
  \caption{The network itself is modeled as a
  \textit{mirroring} component. It transforms calls 
  that propagate (e.g., \texttt{send()}) into 
  calls that consume (e.g., \texttt{recv()}) and 
  reverses the direction of invocation on its output. }
  \label{fig-mirroring}
\end{figure}


Other special components include \textit{manager}
components, which add or remove other components 
and links between components, and
\textit{branching} components, which may invoke 
a function in more than one next component.  
The \textit{Coordination} service discussed 
in detail in Section~\ref{subsec-services-coordination} is a manager, 
and a branching component is illustrated 
in Figure~\ref{fig-tree} (node $A$).


\subsection{Combining Affix components}
\label{subsec-arch-stack}

% \begin{figure}[htb!]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figs/tree.pdf} 
%   \caption{The set of Affix components operating on one
%   socket form a rooted tree, with arcs showing the 
%   invocation relationship between components.}
%   \label{fig-tree}
% \end{figure}


% Validity of permutations doesn't mean every permutation is meaningful.
Affix components that act on a single socket
in an application
are organized as a rooted tree.
Every Affix component is represented as a 
node in the tree, with arcs showing that 
the source node may invoke calls in the destination node.
A sample tree is given
in Figure~\ref{fig-tree}.

When the application calls an 
API function, the call is handled first by the root node.
Each node in the tree may transform the call
and then one or more child nodes. A
terminal node calls the underlying network API, propagating 
the function call to the \ac{OS} network stack, which in turn 
passes data through the network. 


% Given interface compatibility towards both the next-higher and 
% lower layers means that an Affix component need not necessarily 
% call into the actual \ac{OS} socket, or be called by the 
% actual application from above. Rather, Affix components can be 
% situated on top of one another, a setup we refer to as an 
% \textit{Affix stack}. Through stacking, complex functionality 
% can be assembled from multiple simple Affix components, an approach 
% that follows good design practice -- it advertises reuse, and keeps 
% single Affix components light-weight.

% We required before that the composition of services in a 
% componentized networking framework must be dynamically modifiable 
% for it to achieve maximum impact. Each Affix component is therefore 
% aware that it might live in an Affix stack, and includes functionality 
% to modify the stack below it. Specifically, an Affix component can 
% add or remove other Affix components below it to adapt the stack's 
% capabilities to that of the remote side.



\subsection{Propagation of API calls}
\label{subsec-arch-flow}

When connected through the network (which, 
as described in Section~\ref{subsec-arch-stack}, is itself
modeled as a component), 
the Affix components through which data 
for a particular communication travels make up 
a graph. This graph includes the Affix 
tree at each endpoint, as well as those on relays 
or other middleboxes. 
Figure~\ref{fig-dataflow} shows an example of an Affix graph.

\begin{figure*}[htb]

    \begin{tabular}{c c}  
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{figs/tree.pdf}  \hspace{.05cm} &

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{(left) The set of Affix components operating on one
socket form a rooted tree, with arcs showing the 
invocation relationship between components.}
\label{fig-tree}
\caption{(right) This figure shows how Affix components 
  intercept an API call, transform the data and endpoints 
  associated with the call, and propagate the call through 
  an Affix graph until it reaches its destination.}
\label{fig-dataflow}

\end{figure*}

%      \caption{This figure shows how Affix components 
%  intercept an API call, transform the data and endpoints 
%  associated with the call, and propagate the call through 
%  an Affix graph until it reaches its destination.}

%  \caption{This figure shows how Affix components 
%  intercept an API call, transform the data and endpoints 
%  associated with the call, and propagate the call through 
%  an Affix graph until it reaches its destination.}
%  \label{fig-tree}



In Figure~\ref{fig-dataflow}, an application on Host A
calls \texttt{send()} with some data to send and a destination
endpoint. This figure illustrates the requirements for 
a path through the Affix graph to satisfy
end-to-end interface compatibility:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Any non-transparent call must be followed by its mirror
 call.
 \item If a function $f$ that is not data transparent is called 
 before a function $f'$ that is also not data transparent, then 
 their mirror functions must occur in the reverse order: 
 $g'$ before $g$. 
\cappos{Stray thought: What if the order is fgf?   (I know the answer
and the reader will too, but we may get this comment from a reviewer.)}
\item Calls that transform the endpoint associated with a call
must be transparent end-to-end, i.e., their composition must 
satisfy the requirements for transparency described in 
Section~\ref{special}.
\end{itemize}
