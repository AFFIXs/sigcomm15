\begin{abstract}

In this paper, we introduce \acfp{SDS}, a concept facilitating the
reuse, composition, end-to-end deployment, and dynamic configuration
of Transport and Application layer functionality. \ac{SDS} draw
inspiration from recent developments such as \acf{SDR} and \acf{SDN}
that have helped to foster innovation on the lower layers of the
Internet architecture, where cost, complexity, and an existing
predominant protocol suite have constrained development.

Our proposed architecture for \ac{SDS} comprises Application-layer
protocol implementations that exhibit Transport-layer call semantics.
Through this, \ac{SDS} (or stacks of such components) may be added
on top of the existing Transport layer without requiring the calling
application to be modified.

We evaluate Affix, our prototype \ac{SDS} implementation, showing 
that our approach is feasible regarding the overhead inflicted, 
and successfully demonstrates composability, re-configurability, 
and interface compatibility.
